## Default Patches
These patches are included and active by default.  

### EOSLauncherBypass (by BlueAmulet)
EOSLauncherBypass allows the game to be ran directly without the EOS Launcher.  
The game will still initialize EOS afterwards and multiplayer will still work.

### RemoveChatCensor (by Souzooka)
RemoveChatCensor removes chat censorship on your messages, and the messages that other players post.  
Other players will still see your message as censored unless they also have this patch.
